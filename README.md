Generates an png representation of the Newton-Raphson convergence of the complex plane toward the roots of a polynomial. Use run.sh to generate the image file (may take several minutes). The polynomial used is z^3 - 1, but this can be changed by modifying the roots supplied to the grid() function in solver.py.
