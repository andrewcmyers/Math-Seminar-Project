Generates a png representation of the Newton-Raphson convergence of the complex plane toward the roots of a polynomial. Use run.sh to generate the image file, output.png (may take several minutes). The -z, -i, -t, and -a options can be used to specify zoom, iterations, tolerance, and infinite tolerance, respectively.

Requires python3, numpy, scipy, and Pillow.
