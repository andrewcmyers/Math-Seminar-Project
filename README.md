Generates a png representation of the Newton-Raphson convergence of the complex plane toward the roots of a polynomial. Use run.sh to generate the image file, output.png (may take several minutes). The -g, -z, -i, and -c options can be used to specify grid size, zoom, iterations, and contrast, respectively.

Ex.

./run.sh

Coefficients: 1 0 0 -1
